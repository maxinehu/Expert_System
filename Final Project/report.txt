Submit your final project report here. This should be a SINGLE document (Word, PDF, TXT) that contains:

A description of the project (what were you asked to do)
Your design philosophy in creating your solution (how did you go about solving the problem)
The specific changes that you made since Part 1 (either correct problems or extensions to try to improve performance)
The rational for these changes (why were these made)
The improvements that have resulted from changes in your program (both good and bad). Here you should compare your first and second versions of your program to each other.
What would you do differently if you had a chance to start over.
